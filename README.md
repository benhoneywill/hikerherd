### Contribution Policy

hikerherd is a passion project of mine. I want to avoid scope creep and keep my own creative freedom over the codebase and application. Pull requests for new features are a lot of work first to review and then to maintain, therefore I am not looking for code contributions for new features.

If you have ideas for the project or need help with anything, I would still love to hear from you. Visit the [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/benhoneywill/hikerherd/discussions) to start a conversation.

Bug reports are welcome! Please [open an issue](https://github.com/benhoneywill/hikerherd/issues/new/choose) here on github. Code contributions for bug fixes with tests are also very welcome, as are documentation contributions.
